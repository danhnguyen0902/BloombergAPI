BloombergAPI
============
This is my personal project, in which, I try to understand how to use the Bloomberg Open Market API that is available to everyone. 

I did't have a Bloomberg Terminal account, so I searched online, and I found a Bloomberg emulator that can generate random data for a practical use.


Where to get the emulator: http://bemu.codeplex.com/

API Documentation: http://www.openbloomberg.com/files/2012/10/blpapi-developers-guide.pdf

If there's any problem with importing the project into the Android SDK: 
- Click on the project -----> Alt + Enter ------> Go to Order and Export -----> Uncheck the 2 jar files.
