BloombergAPI
============
This is my personal project, in which, I try to understand how to use the Bloomberg Open Market API that is available to everyone. 

I did't have a Bloomberg Terminal account, so I searched online, and I found a Bloomberg emulator that can generate random data for a practical use.
